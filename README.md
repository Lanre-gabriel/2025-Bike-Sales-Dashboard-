- The men should be targeted as they have higher purchasing rate and more likely to buy bikes, Women should be encouraged too.
- Focus  marketing on households with 0-1 Car and individuals whose houses are closer to their work place,they are more likely to buy bikes.
- promotions should be aggressive across Europe and the Pacific regions where sales are low to boost sales.
